* ocamlisp-lipcrepl

** Prerequisites
Assuming one has OCaml installed and properly setup, the only non standard package currently is =menhir=.

Bash instructions:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Install Menhir
opam install menhir
#+END_SRC

** Build
The build can be handled entirely by the =Makefile=.

Bash instructions:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build from source
make
#+END_SRC

If any errors occur, check the generated =output.log= file.

*** Clean
Note: cleaning the compiled files and anything else generated from the build makes merlin in editors wonky, so it's advised to keep =_build/= while editing or viewing code in an editor using merlin, but this will completely clean.

Bash instructions:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build from source
make clean
#+END_SRC
